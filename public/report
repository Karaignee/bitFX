(from wikipedia)Bitcoin[note 2] is a peer-to-peer payment system introduced as open source software in 2009 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital currency created and used in the system is alternatively referred to as a virtual currency, electronic money, or acryptocurrency because cryptography is used to control its creation and transfer.[5] The Bitcoin system is not controlled by a single entity, like a central bank, which has led the US Treasury to call bitcoin a decentralized currency,[6] although it does not meet the generally recognized definition of a currency.
Bitcoins are created by a process called mining, in which users who offer their computing power verify and record payments into a public ledger in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.[7] Users can buy, send and receive bitcoins electronically for a nominal fee using wallet software on a personal computer, mobile device, or a web application. Bitcoins can be obtained by mining or in exchange for products, services, or other currencies.[8]
Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny amid concerns that it can be used for illegal activities.[9] In October 2013 the US FBI shut down the Silk Road online black market and seized 144,000 bitcoins worth US$28.5 million at the time.[10] The US is considered Bitcoin-friendly compared to other governments, however.[11] In China new rules restrict bitcoin exchange for local currency.[12]
Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has seen growth, and merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2–3% typically imposed by credit card processors.[13] The European Banking Authority has warned that Bitcoin lacks consumer protections.[14] Bitcoins can be stolen and chargebacks are impossible.[15]Commercial use of Bitcoin is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility.[16]


Project Scope

The purpose of this project is to produce an online tracking and display of BitCoin and other online currency values

http://www.bss.com.au/solutions/foreign-exchange-rate-display.html (real forex boards)

Area of contribution:
This should describe the general problem area. For example, what is a problem in educational environments and how might they be better developed through the application of a RIA.

BIT currency FX boards and values and charts for online currency holders

• State of the Art Review [30%]
• This section should outline a literature review of the methodologies.
Describe investigation into current practice
** APIs, Angular, JSON, Bootstrap/Responsive, Rails, TDD

Other rich Internet applications, and academic/industrial research that is reported in conferences and journal articles.
** existing FX apps??

Criticial analysis of your selected approach - decision about both the innovation undertaken and the technologies selected.
** why we chose FX & bitcoin, why we picked those tools, what's missing or flawed or slow etc.

• User Interface Design [20%]
how the controls in your application deliver a successful UI experience.
 ** some bullshit

• Architecture [25%]
• Application Architecture:
Outline the solution architecture for your application. You should
justify the approach you took, and how it supports the project
scope. This means mapping back to the state of the art review
when describing the features and functionality of your system.

• Security:
Evaluate industry standard error handling, and outline how you
integrated these approaches within your application.

• Toolkits and Frameworks:
• Discuss the toolkits and frameworks used and the justification for
using them.

• Data Transfer Strategies:
• This section looks at the access and transporting of data to be
consumed/created by the RIA.

• Evaluation and Testing:
You must include a short description of how your application was
evaluated for its audience.
Critically analyse the testing methodology employed, as well as any
debugging techniques you used in building the application.

• Summary [10%]
 brief summary
 what changes you would make
 future work that would benefit your application...

• References [10%]
• Please refer to the Harvard guidebook. Ensure to correctly
reference all resources using the Harvard style of referencing
